## Step 1: Do somthing that has some RNG elements to  and produces output (And set a seed!)

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(100)
numbers<-rnorm(100,2,1)
Output<-mean(numbers)
Output
```



## Step 2: Replicate the results 10 times
```{r echo = TRUE}
replications<-replicate(10,rnorm(100,2,1))
Outputs<-colMeans(replications)
Outputs
``` 

## Step 3: Provide a plot showing the distibution of the mean of the replications allongside a vertical line representing the *"TRUE"* outcome


```{r  echo=FALSE}
hist(Outputs)
abline(v=Output,col="red")
```




### Or, if you prefer a box-plot, a box-plot showing a red circle for the **"TRUE"** value
```{r  echo=FALSE}
boxplot(Outputs)
points(Output,col="red")
```


### Thankfully, it shows that the means of the replications are nicely centered around the true value. Provided the low SD for the sampling method this is to be expected.  

### Add session_info
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

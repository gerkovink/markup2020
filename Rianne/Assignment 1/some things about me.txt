*I like many sports (loved P.E. in school) and also really enjoy watching sports on tv. 
*In the (corona)lockdown I started to expand my plant collection.. As a result I now have 10 avocado 'baby's'.
*I really don't like sushi (and fish in general), which makes me pretty unique but also often a disappointment to other people who want to go eat/order sushi.
*I got really fond of the Flemish language/dialect when I was about 10 years old and watched a movie dubbed in Flemish. I even gave a presentation about Flemish in high school. 
Extra fun fact is that I also have a Flemish boyfriend, but he speaks Dutch (dialect) when he is with me (he worked in the Netherlands and his father is Dutch).. He can only speak the Flemish dialect with Flemish people, with me he automatically switches to Dutch. 
*I have two goldfish, named Bert and Ernie. They make really good (student house resistant) pets. 
*I really really love 'kaassoufl√©'s'. 
*I played soccer in one of the first girls teams in my region, and at that time we still played against boys. One time, we made some young boys cry because they lost against girls..

## Movie night planning

Let's plan a movie night. This has to be carefully executed in several steps.

```{r, echo = F}

library(DT)
prep <- matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
colnames(prep) <- c("Preparation", "Food")
prep[,1] <- c("Take the night off", "Invite friends over", "tidy up your living room")
prep[,2] <- c("Drinks", "chips (salt flavor)", "your favorite chocolate")
prep%>% datatable(options = list(pageLength = 3))
```

## Some very carefully selected scenes

## Let's not 


Let $x$ be the money you owe some guy you don't really know. Your debt increases by $x$ every year. What do you owe this guy after w years?




$$\begin{align*}
y &\sim Trouble(500, 100) \\
y &=  x * w
\end{align*}$$





## 'This is not an academic topic'


```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center', echo=F}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("pic.jpg")
```



## In conclusion

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, cache=T}
to_round_this_off <-
  function(x) 
    print("Let's sum this up.")
```



**" Is this your homework, Larry?"** [@elduderino]

Yes, it is.

About me.
28-09-2020

Let me introduce myself. My name is ZoÃ« Dunias, I am 23 years old and I live in Eindhoven. Currently, I am a student of the Methodology and Statistics Master's programme at Utrecht University. 
In addition, I much enjoy being involved as a board member in the Methodology And Statistics Alumni Society (MASAS) foundation.

In my spare time I like to work out, be outdoors and read books.

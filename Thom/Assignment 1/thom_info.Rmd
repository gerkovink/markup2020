Hi,

![](thom.jpeg){width=300px}

I'm Thom, I'm `r floor((as.numeric(as.Date(Sys.time())) - as.numeric(as.Date("09-12-1996", format = "%d-%m-%Y"))) / 365.25)` years old, and I happen to live in Utrecht. Next to the Methods and Statistics master, I am also enrolled in the Sociology and Social Research master program, which is a pretty nice way of extending my time as a student. I have an interest in programming and statistical methods, in particular methods of research synthesis.

In my spare time, I enjoy to ride my bike a few times a week (if I have time, it sometimes is only a few times a month), and if I would have time, I would also watch the Tour de France pretty much everyday. Additionally, I like to cook, read a book, or watch some other sport games like football or basketball.

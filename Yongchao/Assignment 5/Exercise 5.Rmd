  I am a research master student and research assistant in the Department of Methodology and Statistics.
  
  Currently, I am writing my Master's thesis at **Statistics Netherlands (CBS)** under the supervision of Dr. Nino Mushkudiani and Prof. Dr. Barry Schouten. My research project is **optimal stratification in Bayesian adaptive survey designs**. This research aims to reduce nonresponse bias by effectively and efficiently stratifying the target population into subgroups that can be approached by different data collection strategies.
  
  I am also a core team member of **ASReview** â€“ open-source software for screening academic papers with machine learning techniques [@vandeschoot2020open]. Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Rens van de Schoot, **my task involves** 1) preprocess the metadata of training data sets, 2) back-end Python API, and front-end Javascript UI development.
